You are free to use, distribute, and modify this code, as long as you cite the respective papers/references:

[Can I modify the code?] 
Yes, you can. In fact, I actively encourage it! It would be great if you could release any modifications that you make to the code, so that they can be shared by everyone. I'm not a stickler about it, though, as long as: (a) you're nice about it, (b) make good faith attempts to describe and/or share your modifications if asked, and (c) you give proper credit. 
But please do email me if you get stuck: cescamilla@mctp.mx
